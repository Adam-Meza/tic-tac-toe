### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?
Bordem is and always will be an existential issue. In the 90's kids may have played Pokemon.
In the mid-centuary, kids might have played kick the can. In the 1800's they probably just stared at a wall or something. In 2023, kids will play Tic Tac Toe!
This application effectively and effortlessly solves the long standing issue of bordem forver by allowing users to play
one of the most loved games internationally in a digital way! Users can choose 1 player mode and play against a computer,
or bring a friend along play with 2 players. 


### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This appliction was designed, built, and refined over a 1 week timeline as the final project of the first module of the 
Turing program.

### Learning Goals:
The learning goals of this project were:
- Solidify and demonstrate an understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
  
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Using a problem solving process to break down large problems, solving things step by step

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
During this project the work that proved to be the most challenging revolved around achieving functionality while maintaining DRY and SRP standards of code.
I found that the more complex my project became the harder it was to keep track of what functions were and weren't dynamic enough to support a wide variety of usages.
I solved this by extensively psuedocoding and plotting out far each step as I added it on. 

Another challenge that I actually enjoyed was figuring out how to handle the win condition of my game. This required a large amount of preperation before a single line of code was written.
By extending my ideation stage beyond what might be considered normal I was able to very rapidly execute the MVP for this project.
